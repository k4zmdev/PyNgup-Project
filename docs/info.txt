Description :
Ngup is a powerful Python tool that analyzes files by retrieving their hash values (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) 
and extracting all available information related to the file. It helps determine if a file is known 
to be malicious by comparing its hashes against various known threat databases and metadata sources.

-----------------------------------------------
Main Features :
- Compute multiple file hash types
- Lookup hash reputation
- Display detailed file metadata
- Check if a file or hash is flagged as malicious
- CLI-based tool with modular architecture
- Python 3.12.x compatibility
