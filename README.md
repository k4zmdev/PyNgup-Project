# 🚀 **PyNgup Project** 🛡️

**PyNgup** is a Python-based tool that helps you **retrieve file hashes**, **extract related information**, and **determine whether a hash is malicious** or not. It cross-references file hashes with various threat intelligence sources to assess potential security risks.

## 🔥 Features

- 🔍 Retrieve file hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).
- 🛡️ Lookup hash information from external databases to check for known malicious files.
- 🧠 Integrate with popular threat intelligence platforms.
- 🔧 Customizable hash file analysis with easy-to-use Python functions.

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started with **PyNgup**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/k4zmdev/PyNgup-Project.git
    cd PyNgup-Project
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you're using **Python 3.12.x** or later for compatibility.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage
To check a file's hash and determine if it is malicious, run the following command:

```bash
python pyngup.py --hash <file_hash>
````

Where `<file_hash>` is the **MD5**, **SHA-1**, or **SHA-256** hash of the file you want to analyze.

### Example:

```bash
python pyngup.py --hash 4d186321c1a7f0f354b297e8914ab240
```

This will return the analysis of the provided hash, checking it against known threat databases.
